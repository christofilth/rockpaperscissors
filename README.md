for The Odin Project's foundations course

## Introduction
For this project, I am recreating the game Rock, Paper, Scissors in JavaScript, to be played in a browser console.

The full assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

### Setup the project structure
Created a [Git repository](https://github.com/christofilth/rockpaperscissors).
Created blank html document with script tag, linking to external .js file. Tested link between .html and .js with console.log().

### Write the logic to get the computer choice
Wrote pseudocode for getComputerChoice function. Wrote code for getComputerChoice function. The function creates a random number from 1-100, and then returns either the words Rock, Paper or Scissors depending on the range of the number, 1-33 = Rock etc. Code tested in browser console.
